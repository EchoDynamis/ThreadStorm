# Project and Report Structure

## Overview

You have two tasks to complete individually: a **report** and a **project**. The report involves analyzing race conditions, deadlocks, and finite state automata. The project focuses on applying concurrent programming concepts, originally specified with PVM in C and Java, but you’d prefer Rust. Since the professor allows any language emphasizing concurrency libraries, Rust is a viable option given your basic knowledge.

This document outlines a structured pathway for both tasks, tailored for streaming, with clear sections and steps.

## Report Section

### 1. Identify Race Conditions and Deadlocks

- **Objective:**  
  - Provide examples of code showing a race condition in its critical section and a deadlock.  
  - Explain each example in detail, identifying where the issues occur.

- **Steps:**  
  1. Write or find a simple Rust code snippet with a race condition (e.g., multiple threads accessing a shared variable without synchronization).  
  2. Write or find a Rust code snippet demonstrating a deadlock (e.g., two threads holding and waiting for locks in a circular pattern).  
  3. Explain the critical section, shared resources, and conditions causing the race condition or deadlock.

### 2. Finite State Automata

- **Objective:**  
  - Summarize deterministic finite automata (DFA).  
  - Solve exercises 1 and 2 from the provided DFA material.

- **Steps:**  
  1. Review DFA concepts: states, transitions, alphabet, start state, and accept states.  
  2. Write a concise summary of how DFAs work and their role in state transitions.  
  3. Solve the two exercises, documenting your process (great for streaming!).

### 3. Conclusion

- **Objective:**  
  - Relate race conditions, deadlocks, and DFAs to concurrent programming.  
  - Highlight current trends in the field.

- **Steps:**  
  1. Discuss how these concepts affect concurrent program design and debugging.  
  2. Research and briefly mention trends (e.g., Rust’s rise in systems programming, advances in concurrency models).

### Stage 1: Elements and Functionalities of Concurrent Programming

#### I. Identification and Analysis of Concurrency in Rust

- **1.1 Identify Rust’s Concurrency Primitives**  
  - **Objective:** List and describe Rust’s concurrency tools (e.g., threads, mutexes, channels).  
  - **Steps:**  
    1. Explore Rust’s `std::thread`, `std::sync::Mutex`, and `std::sync::mpsc` (channels).  
    2. Write small examples showing their use (e.g., spawning a thread, locking a mutex).

- **1.2 Determine the Functionality of These Primitives**  
  - **Objective:** Explain how Rust’s concurrency tools work.  
  - **Steps:**  
    1. Document the purpose of each primitive (e.g., threads for parallelism, mutexes for synchronization).  
    2. Test examples and note their behavior in concurrent scenarios.

#### II. Identify Functionalities of Concurrent Programming

- **2.1 Develop a Program to Sum Numbers in a Range**  
  - **Objective:**  
    - Create a sequential version.  
    - Create a concurrent version using Rust’s concurrency features.  
    - Document runs and tests.  
  - **Steps:**  
    1. Write a sequential Rust program to sum numbers from command-line input (e.g., `1 to 1000`).  
    2. Rewrite it using Rust’s concurrency (e.g., Rayon for parallel iteration or threads for master-slave style).  
    3. Test both versions with large ranges, logging performance and correctness.  
    4. Document the process, comparing sequential vs. concurrent outcomes.

## Feasibility of Using Rust

- **Rust’s Concurrency Support:**  
  - Rust excels at concurrency with its ownership model and libraries like `std::thread`, `std::sync`, and Rayon (for parallelism).  
  - No direct PVM support, but you can replicate PVM’s master-slave architecture with threads or channels.

- **Learning Curve:**  
  - Your basic Rust knowledge (chapters 1-3) covers variables, functions, and control flow—enough to start. Concurrency will build on this.

- **Project Fit:**  
  - The project emphasizes concurrency concepts (e.g., communication, parallelism), not PVM specifically. Rust can meet these goals.

- **Challenges:**  
  - No PVM library in Rust; you’ll use native concurrency tools instead.  
  - May need to adapt the master-slave design without “xpvm” (consider Rust profiling tools like `cargo flamegraph`).

- **Recommendations:**  
  1. **Confirm with Professor:** Verify Rust is acceptable, as the original spec mentions PVM in C/Java.  
  2. **Use Rust Libraries:**  
     - Rayon: Simple parallelism for the sum program.  
     - `std::sync`: Mutexes and channels for synchronization.  
  3. **Stream Adaptation:** Show how Rust’s ownership prevents common concurrency bugs (a great teaching moment!).

## Streaming Tips

- **Break into Segments:**  
  - “Coding a Race Condition in Rust”  
  - “Solving DFA Exercise 1”  
  - “Building a Concurrent Sum Program”  
- **Engage Viewers:** Pre-plan explanations (e.g., “Here’s why this mutex prevents a race condition”).  
- **Show Progress:** Use Git commits or live outputs to demonstrate steps.

This structure keeps you focused, leverages Rust, and makes for an awesome stream!
